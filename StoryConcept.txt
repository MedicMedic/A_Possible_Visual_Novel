The protagonist is me.

Story routes/endings:

-Singer
-Artist
-Writer
-Housewife/romance
-YouTuber
-Doctor
-Engineer
-Office job
-Depressed

Each route has a MAX ending.

Singer: take on performance/audio skills
Artist: take on visual skills
Writer: take on literary/speech skills
Romance: completely pursue love interest
YouTuber: take on multiple artistic skills and sacrifice quality
Doctor: take on educational skills and be empathetic
Engineer: take on educational skills and be analytic
Office job: take on educational skills, choose no special trait
Depressed: balance everything

You can't have it all. You must choose what exactly you want to do with your life. If you try to have it all, you'll lose it all, too.

In real life, I'm currently taking the depressed route.
