# Possible: A Visual Novel

*Are we gonna fall in love?*

*Are we gonna shake in terror?*

*Are we gonna cry ugly tears?*

*Or, perhaps, we'd decide that for ourselves?*

You are an 18-year-old woman with your life ahead of you. Many paths are open for you, but which one will you take? Which one will make you the best version of yourself?

It's all in your choices.
