After a tumultuous 17th year, you are finally 18! You have gained many talents and experiences over your whole life. You just started college and bonus, you still have a boyfriend! 

There's a remarkable life ahead of you, but what comes next? Will you chase your dreams or will you change them? Will you play it safe or risk it all? Will you fall in love or be heartbroken? Will you try to have it all? 

There are no right or wrong answers. Only you will decide what is truly *possible*. 

But remember, no one can have everything.

Good luck and welcome to adulthood.
